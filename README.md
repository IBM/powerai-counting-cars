## Flow
1. Upload a video using the PowerAI Vision web UI.
2. Use auto-labeling and train a model.
3. Deploy the model to create a PowerAI Vision REST API.
4. Use a Jupyter Notebook to detect, track, and count cars in a video.

# Sample output

As the notebook cells run, check for errors and watch the progress indicators. After the video has been annotated, the frames will play (like a video) in the notebook. The notebook playback is usually slow.

Use the ffmpeg command provided in the last notebook cell to create an MP4 video from the frames for a higher quality, full speed playback.
